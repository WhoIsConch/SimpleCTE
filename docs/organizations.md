# Organizations

Organizations are one of the main components of SimpleCTE, and probably the biggest deal. 
With organizations, a user can manage all information they need to know about a business,
community, or other partner. 

Organizations have a variety of fields, which can all be edited through the Organization View screen.
The Organization View screen can be accessed by double-clicking an organization in the search screen,
or by selecting the `View` option in the alt-click menu of an organization. Organizations
can also be viewed via the aforementioned methods in any other table that lists an Organization.

View the [examples](#examples) section for some examples of how to use Organizations in a SimpleCTE database.
