# Contacts

Contacts are one of the main components of SimpleCTE. Contacts allow users to manage all
known information about a student, teacher, organization contact, or other person. 

Contacts have a variety of fields, which can all be edited through the Contact View screen.
The Contact View screen can be accessed by double-clicking a contact in the search screen,
or by selecting the `View` option in the alt-click menu of a contact. Contacts
can also be viewed via the aforementioned methods in any other table that lists a Contact.
