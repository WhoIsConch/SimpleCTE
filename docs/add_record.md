# Creating Records

## Creating Organizations or Contacts

Creating a new organization or contact can be done through
the respective Record View or Record Search screen via the `Add Record`
button. This will open a form where you can input basic information
about a contact or organization. Afterward, the program will open the 
Record View screen with the new record displayed, where you can make more
advanced edits to the record.

## Creating Resources

Creating a resource can be done through an Organization or Record View
screen. Alt-clicking on the `Resources` table in the viewer will display
a list of options related to resources, where "Create Resource" can be found.
Clicking this will open a form where you can input a resource name and value.
The resource will then be automatically linked to the organization or contact
that you were viewing.
